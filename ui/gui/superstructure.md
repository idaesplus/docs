## Major Features

* Create superstructures composed of feedstock, processing stages, and target products with a drag-and-drop UI
* Add units to processing stages, configuring performance and cost of each
* Connect processing units between adjacent stages
* Run optimization and determine optimal connections for cost objective

## Examples

### Build superstructure

Superstructure (for HDD extraction) with input dialog shown for one unit.
```

### Solve superstructure
