- description: 'The Evaporation Pond model is a general purpose model for representing
    evaporation ponds (both solar and enhanced). Currently, the model only supports
    steady-state operation

    (although it could be easily extended to dynamics). The model also only supports
    material balances with equilibrium reactions, as energy and momentum balances
    are less meaningful given the open-air nature of these operations and the long-duration
    time

    constants involved.'

- description: 'This is an example flowsheet for the separation of lithium and magnesium
    ions using nanofiltration (NF). The unit model is the Donnan Steric Pore Model
    with Dielectric Exclusion (DSPM-DE) and the property model is the Multi-Component
    Aqueous Solution (MCAS) property package, both of which can be found in WaterTAP.
    Currently, the inlet feed is modeling the Salar de Atacama brine.


    The objective of the Pyomo model is to limit the amount of lithium lost in the
    retentate stream, with 2 degrees of freedom (pressure, area). Operating at this
    extreme end of the tradeoff between the selectivity and permeability, combined
    with the low solvent flux for this example, the magnesium rejection is low (~14%).
    An additional constraint is enacted on the model to limit the feed pressure to
    70 bar, per typical experimental capabilities.

  description: "REE Oxalate Roaster is a unit operation to convert oxalates of rare\
    \ earth and gangue metal\nelements to metal oxides through thermal decomposition\
    \ and oxidation. There are 18 rare earth elements\nincluding `Sc`, `Y`, `La`,\
    \ `Ce`, `Pr`, `Nd`, `Pm`, `Sm`, `Eu`, `Gd`, `Tb`, `Dy`, `Ho`, `Er`, `Tm`, `Yb`,\
    \ `Lu`,\nand `Th` in the model. The user can specify a subset of those 18 elements\
    \ through configuration when creating\nthe unit model. The 3 gangue elements considered\
    \ in the model are `Fe`, `Al`, and `Ca`.\n\nThe feed oxalate mixture stream is\
    \ typically from a precipitator in an upstream process. It is assumed\nthat all\
    \ oxalates are in their hydrate forms. In case the anhydrous oxalate feed flow\
    \ rates are specified in\nthe property package of the solid feed stream, the molar\
    \ flow rates are converted to the corresponding hydrate flow rates. \nThe molecular\
    \ formula of an oxalate hydrate can be expressed in a general form as :ce:`RE2(C2O4)3\
    \ \\\\cdot xH2O` where RE is\none of the 18 rare earth elements and x is the number\
    \ of water molecules associated with the hyrate. The three \ngangue oxalate hydrates\
    \ considered in the model are :ce:`Fe2(C2O4)3 \\\\cdot 2H2O`, :ce:`Al2(C2O4)3\
    \ \\\\cdot H2O`, and\n:ce:`CaC2O4 \\\\cdot H2O`, for `Fe`, `Al`, and `Ca` elements,\
    \ respectively.\n\nThe feed stream contains surface moisture. The amount of surface\
    \ moisture entering the reactor is specified by\na liquid inlet that contains\
    \ a fraction of the liquid outlet of the precipitator."
